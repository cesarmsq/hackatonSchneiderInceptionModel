## Dataset:
* `latitude`: Where the photo latitude was taken.
* `longitude`: Where the photo longitude was taken.
* `year`: Year, in which the photo was taken.
* `example_path`: Path where the sample image is located.
* `label`: In this column you will have the following categories:
    * `Plantation`: 0
    * `Grassland/Shrubland`: 1
    * `Smallholder Agriculture`: 2

## Task
1. Create a classification predictive model in order to be able to classify the testing images. First train your model with the training images, once you have the model that maximize the f1-score (macro.) use the test images as input for your model.

2. Create a presentation (MAX 4 slides) explaining what you have done and why you have done it.
